# Cost Reduction AWS

## Services

### AWS Budgets
With AWS Budgets, set custom budgets to track your costs and usage, and quickly respond to alerts you receive from email or SNS notifications if you exceed your limit.

### AWS Budgets Reports
With AWS Budgets, you can configure a report to monitor the performance of your existing budgets on a daily, weekly, or monthly cadence and deliver that report to up to 50 email addresses.

You can create up to 50 reports for each standalone account or AWS Organizations management account. Each budget report costs $.01 USD for each report delivered. This is regardless of the number of recipients receiving the report. For example, a daily budget report costs $.01 USD a day, a weekly budget report costs $.01 USD a week, and a monthly budget report costs $.01 USD a month.

### Tags
To help you manage Amazon EC2 instances, images, and other resources, you can assign your own metadata to each resource in the form of tags. Tags let you categorize your AWS resources in different ways (such as by purpose, by owner, or by environment). This is useful when you have many resources of the same type â€” you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it.
